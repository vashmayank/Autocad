# AutoCAD 2D Practice Drawings by Mayank

Welcome to my collection of **42+ AutoCAD 2D practice drawings**, organized by difficulty and complexity. This repository is a result of my dedicated practice and learning journey in 2D CAD drafting, focusing on accuracy, speed, and best practices.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The drawings are divided into four main folders based on complexity:

- `set_easy1/`  
  Basic foundational drawings to build core 2D skills.

- `set_easy2/`  
  More easy-level exercises, helping reinforce basic techniques.

- `set_med1/`  
  Intermediate-level drawings that introduced me to more complex shapes and constraints.

- `set_hard_real1/`  
  Advanced real-world components and mechanical parts. These drawings were challenging and required significant attention to dimensions and accuracy.

Each folder contains:

- `.dwg` files (AutoCAD drawing files)
- Corresponding screenshots for quick preview (helpful if you don’t have a CAD viewer)

## 🛠️ Key Highlights

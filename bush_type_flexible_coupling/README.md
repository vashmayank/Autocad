# Bush Type Flexible Coupling - 2D Drawing and Assembly

## Project Overview

Hello, I’m **Mayank**, and I’m excited to share my project on designing a **Bush Type Flexible Coupling**. This coupling consists of **8 key components**: **flange (male and female), key, bush, nut, bolt, shaft, and washer**. It is designed to connect two shafts while allowing flexibility to absorb misalignments, shock loads, and vibrations.

I have created **2D drawings** of both the individual parts and their **assembly** using **Mechanical AutoCAD**. These drawings follow **industry standards**(as of my knowledge), ensuring that the design is functional, durable, and easy to manufacture.

## Project Components

This **Bush Type Flexible Coupling** consists of the following parts:

1. **Flange (Male and Female)**: These components connect the coupling to the shafts.
2. **Key**: This transmits the torque between the flanges and the shafts.
3. **Bush**: The flexible part that compensates for shaft misalignment and absorbs shocks.
4. **Nut**: This secures the coupling components to the shafts.
5. **Bolt**: Works with the nut to hold all parts in place.
6. **Shaft**: The element to which the coupling is attached.
7. **Washer**: Distributes load evenly and prevents the nut from loosening.
8. **Assembly**: The final assembled coupling showing how all the parts fit together.

## Project Details

This project includes **two DWG files** located in the root folder, which contains the following:

### Flange-Coupling.dwg

This drawing contains **three sheets**:

1. **Sheet 1**: Includes the 2D drawings of the **first four parts**: Flange-Male, Flange-Female, Key, and Shaft.
2. **Sheet 2**: Shows the **remaining four parts**: Nut, Bolt, Washer, and Bush.
3. **Sheet 3**: Displays the **full assembly diagram** with all parts together. This sheet also contains the **Bill of Materials (BoM)** and **Title Blocks** for proper documentation.

## File Structure

The files in the root folder are organized as follows:

- **DWG Files**:
  - **flange-coupling.dwg** – Contains the drawings for the individual parts and the full assembly, along with title blocks and BoM.
  - **saved-assembly.dwg** – Cntains the assembly as a single object.

- **Screenshot Folder**:
  - This folder contains screenshots for each of the individual parts, the full view, and the assembly:
    - **Part 1**: Flange (Male)
    - **Part 2**: Flange (Female)
    - **Part 3**: Shaft
    - **Part 4**: Key
    - **Part 5**: Bush
    - **Part 6**: Bolt
    - **Part 7**: Nut
    - **Part 8**: Washer
    - **Full View**: Complete view of the coupling assembly.
    - **Assembly**: The complete assembled coupling diagram.
    - **All Sheets**: All three sheets from the **Flange-Coupling.dwg** file.

## Industry Standards

All components and their assembly have been designed in accordance with **industry standards** for mechanical components as of my kowledge. While I created the designs from scratch, I used **online resources** for **dimensioning** and **technical accuracy** to ensure the coupling meets real-world performance standards.

## How to Use the Files

1. **Clone** the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vashmayank/Autocad/Flange_coupling.git
    cd bush-flexible-coupling
    ```

2. Open the **DWG files** using **AutoCAD** or any compatible **2D CAD software**.

3. Review the individual part drawings in **Sheet 1** and **Sheet 2**.

4. Refer to **Sheet 3** for the full assembly diagram, including the **Bill of Materials** and detailed dimensions.

5. Use the **screenshot folder** for visual references of each part, the assembly, and full views.

## Conclusion

I’ve completed the design of this **Bush Type Flexible Coupling** entirely by myself using **Mechanical AutoCAD**. The project is a result of **careful design work** and **attention to detail**. For accurate dimensions and technical specifications, I referred to **online resources** to ensure the design meets real-world requirements.

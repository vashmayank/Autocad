# 🔩 Universal Coupling Design (2D + 3D) | AutoCAD Project

Hey! I'm **Mayank** (@vashmayank) and this is my project on a **Universal Coupling** – fully modeled in **AutoCAD**, both in **2D detail drawings** and **3D assembled form**.

This project helped me practice mechanical design, understand assemblies, and improve my CAD workflow.

## 📂 What's Inside

🧱 **Parts Designed (2D + 3D):**
- 2× Fork
- 2× Shaft
- 2× Collar
- 2× Taper Pin
- 2× Pin
- 1× Centre Block

🛠️ **Assembly:**
- Complete 3D assembly of the universal coupling
- All parts properly constrained and aligned
- No fillets added in 3D (intentionally skipped for clean edges)

🖼️ **Screenshots:**
- All screenshots are included in the root folder
- Shows different views of both 2D layouts and the 3D assembly

📁 **DWG Files Location:**
- `dwg_files/universal-couling-2d.dwg` – Detailed 2D part drawings
- `wg_files/universal-coupling.dwg` – Assembled 3D model

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

- Used **best practices** for 2D detailing and layering
- Followed correct part modeling flow in 3D
- Assembled parts logically like in real-world fitting
- Included all essential coupling components
- Learned a lot about mechanical movement + constraints

## 💡 Why This Project?

Universal couplings are used in shafts with angular misalignment, so it's a real-world, industry-relevant project. This helped me:
- Practice **fitment between moving parts**
- Work with **symmetrical part modeling**
- Assemble using **logical constraints**
- Strengthen my **CAD & design skills**

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **AutoCAD 2024**
- 2D Drafting Workspace
- 3D Modeling Workspace

---

## 🧠 Still Improving...

- Planning to apply **fillets and realistic constraints** in future
- Looking to render with materials later
